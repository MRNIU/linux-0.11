            write access you can upload any changes you make to the CVS server for others
            to use. A few extra steps are required the first time you use CVS write
            access.</P

                will create a home directory on that machine for you. That's it! If you try
                it again, it will say "This is a restricted Shell Account. You cannot execute
                anything here." At this point, you've succeeded and you never have to do
                this step again, ever.

            Just type yes. When it asks for a password, be sure to type your source
            forge password. If you have trouble logging in, be sure to use your SOURCE
            FORGE username and password in the ssh line, which isn't necessarily the same
            as your local username and password. Add the "-v" option to ssh to see more
            information about what is failing. If you have ssh version 2, it is possible
            that you might need to add "-1" to the ssh command to force it to use the
            version 1 protocol.  </P
