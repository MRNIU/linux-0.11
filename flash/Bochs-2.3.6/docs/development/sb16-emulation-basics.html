            output unless the application doesn't do much in the background (or the
            foreground, really). The sound tends to looping or crackle on slower
            computer, but the emulation appears to be correct. Even a MOD
            player works, although only for lower sampling speeds.</P

            into a SMF, that is the standard midi file. The wave output
            can be written into a VOC file, which has a format defined by
            Creative Labs. This file format can be converted to WAV by
            sox for example.</P

        >Output is supported on Linux and Windows 95 at the moment.
            On Linux, the output goes to any file or device. If you have a
            wavetable synthesizer, midi can go to /dev/midi00, otherwise you may need
            a midi interpreter. For example, the midid program from the
            DosEmu project would work. Wave output should go to /dev/dsp.
            These devices are assumed to be OSS devices, if they're not
            some of the ioctl's might fail.
            On Windows, midi and output goes to the midi mapper and the wave mapper,
            respectively. A future version might have selectable output devices.</P

            Usually about four buffers of 4096 bytes produce best results. Smaller
            buffers could mean too much overhead, while larger buffers contribute
            to the fact that the actual output will always be late when the application
            tries to synchronize it with for example graphics.</P
