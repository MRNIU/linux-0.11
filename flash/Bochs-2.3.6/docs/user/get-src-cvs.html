    <P
    >CVS, or Concurrent Version System, is a software development tool that helps
        to keep track of the different revisions of each file. It is used by many
        open source (and commercial) projects to allow multiple developers to share
        their changes to the source code. The Bochs source code and documentation
        are available using CVS<A

        <P
        >When you have CVS installed, the first step is to do a login and checkout. The
            initial checkout command is long and ugly, but usually you only have to do it
            once. The example below shows the CVS checkout process in Unix. On the
            Windows platform, you can download a CVS client from cvshome.com, or
            use CVS within Cygwin<A

        that CVS remembers which tag you have used most recently. The tag is stored
        in the CVS subdirectory, so it stays around even if you log off and
        return later. After creating a sticky tag, any future cvs updates will
        try to keep your directory in sync with the version you chose. In other
        words, when developers check in changes you will not
        see them because your directory is "stuck" looking at an old version.
        To clear the sticky tag, use <B
                CLASS="COMMAND"
        >cvs update -A</B
