            are very UNLIKELY to get flamed and insulted for being a Bochs beginner.
            Sending commercial promotions to the list probably will get you some angry
            responses though.</P

            For best results, be sure not to put a space between "site:" and "bochs.sourceforge.net". Be sure to look at
            more than the first item on the search results.</P

        >If you still cannot find what you are looking for, be sure you are prepared when you post your question, and
            post in the right forum. Be sure you include important details, such as the operating system and version of
            your host, and what it is you are trying to do. If you are getting errors or something is not working,
            summarize what you checked and what you changed. This will help isolate the problem.</P

            large screen shot or disk image, put it on a web or FTP site and tell people
            how to find it. Patches are usually small enough that they aren't a problem,
            especially if compressed.</P
