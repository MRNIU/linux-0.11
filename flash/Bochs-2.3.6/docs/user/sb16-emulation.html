            output unless the application doesn't do much in the background (or the
            foreground, really). The sound tends to looping or crackle on slower
            computer, but the emulation appears to be correct. Even a MOD
            player works, although only for lower sampling speeds.</P

            into a SMF, that is the standard midi file. The wave output
            can be written into a VOC file, which has a format defined by
            Creative Labs. This file format can be converted to WAV by
            sox for example.</P
